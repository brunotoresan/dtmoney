## ðŸ”¥ About the project
This is the second React project developed watching the Ignite's Rocketseat course by @diego3g. This is a personal finance app where the user can visualize his/her sources of income, expenses, and the final balance to see if he/she is on profit or debt. The user can also add financial transactions with its name, value, type (gain/loss), and category. In this project I learned and practiced a lot of important concepts including: 
- Applying **CSS-in-JS** with the `styled-components` library to create styled components
- Using `MirageJS` to mock APIs and create a fully functional front-end withou having to rely on backend services
- Creating a modal
- Configuring the `Axios` client HTTP to intercept API's requests/responses to change its data before it reaches the back-end
- **Using React Context to share data between components**
- Creating hooks to easily share contexts
